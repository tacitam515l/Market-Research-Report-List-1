<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Stimulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Embedding Stimulator</li><li>Semi-embedding Stimulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal stimulator market is divided into two main types: full embedding stimulators and semi-embedding stimulators. Full embedding stimulators are implanted entirely within the body, providing a discreet solution for chronic pain management, with enhanced safety and lower visibility. In contrast, semi-embedding stimulators are partially implanted, making them easier to adjust or remove while still offering effective pain relief. Each type caters to different patient needs, preferences, and specific medical conditions, influencing their adoption in pain management practices.</p></p>
